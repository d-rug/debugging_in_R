# What is a bug?

![](images/computer-bug.jpg){fig-alt="moth taped to notebook page with caption \"first case of bug being found\"" width="300"}


::: {style="font-size: 130%;"}

Computer code not behaving as you *expect* it to
:::

## Debugging Tasks

1.  Identify the bug

2.  Locate (the cause of) the bug

3.  Investigate the bug

4.  Reproduce the bug

5.  Fix the bug

6.  Prevent prevent bug

## Investigative Functions

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   `print()`
-   `head()`
-   `str()`
-   `View()`
-   `dim()`
-   `range()`
-   `table()`
-   `class()`

and many more...
:::

# 1. Identify the bug

::: {style="font-size: 125%;"}
First, create expectations:
:::

-   in your mind

-   with unit tests ([testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/))

::: {style="font-size: 125%;"}
Then, check those expectations (frequently)
:::

-   With investigative functions

-   with unit tests ([testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/))

## 2. Locate the bug

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   Start debugging with an empty environment
-   Run script interactively in the console and use investigative functions
-   Breakpoints
-   For functions:
    -   `debug()` and `debugonce()`
    -   `browser()` and `trace()`
-   For rmarkdown/quarto:
    -   break up larger chunks into smaller ones
    -   run code in console
:::

## 3. Investigate the bug

-   Update R (or and relevant packages)
-   Built-in R documentation via `?` or `help()`
-   The [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) page or [Github](https://github.com/) repository for a specific package
-   Google
    -   Copy/paste error messages
    -   Include "R" and names of any packages you are using
    -   Specify the function you think may be causing the problem
    -   Mention the data type/class you are working with

## 4. Reproduce the bug aka Ask for Help

-   Do your homework and exhaust your options from Step 3 first
-   Use a clear and concise title
-   Describe your goal, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened
-   Copy/paste output from `sessionInfo()` into your post
-   Include a reprex

# Reprex: Re(producible) Ex(ample)

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}
The smallest chunk of code that triggers your bug and can be run on any computer.
:::

## Reprex Tips

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   Create the reprex in a separate script
-   List all packages loaded in your environment
-   Simulate data, use builtin data or provide an easily accessible small subset of your data (no csvs)
-   Remove all extraneous packages and code
-   Clear your environment/restart R before testing your reprex
-   Test your reprex to make sure it triggers the error
-   No Screenshots!
:::

Of course there is a tidyverse package for that: [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)

## Where to ask?

-   [D-RUG Discourse](https://d-rug.discourse.group/top?period=all)
-   [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
-   [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help)
-   [RStudio Forum](https://community.rstudio.com/)
-   The [Github](https://github.com/) repository for a specific package
-   [Datalab Office Hours](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/office-hours/)

## 5. Fix the bug

-   `try()` and `tryCatch()`
-   Write your own functions that avoid the issue
-   Report the bug
    -   `packageDescription()` to find bug report location
    -   often times this is done by creating an [issue](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_git_for_teams/opening-issues-and-making-changes.html) on Github
-   Make sure that the problem is actually a bug and not just a behavior you don't like

## 6. Prevent the bug

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   `try()` and `tryCatch()`
-   Document, document, document!
    -   #comments
    -   [READMEs](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_how-to-data-documentation/)
    -   [commit messages](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_introduction_to_version_control/creating-your-first-repo.html#save-stage-commit)
    -   [Github Issues](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_git_for_teams/opening-issues-and-making-changes.html)
-   Write your own error messages using `stop()` or warnings using `warning()`
-   Follow up on any posts you made with the solution that actually worked
